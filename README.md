Keep your body in shape with the best workout's tracking that lets u get all the work in and maximise your entire body strength with a workout tracking app using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

They can then add cardio or resistance sessions to each workout. The dashboard displays statistics about the various exercises and workouts.

A user simply just has to log the app or get it running, add or continue with previous workouts by clicking the add or complete buttons and also click on the dashboard link at the navigation bar to view the stats of their workouts
